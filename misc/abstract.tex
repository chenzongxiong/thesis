\textit{Hysteresis} is defined as a \textit{rate independent} process with \textit{memory effect}. A wide class of hysteretic systems is formed by an elementary block, \textit{Preisach operator}. In this thesis, we approximate this kind hysteretic by neural network.
RNNs can approximate processes with memory, but standard architectures such as LSTM fail to learn the hysteretic relation from inputs and outputs.
We develop a new network architecture, namely HNN, which is a realization of a linear combination of nonlinear \textit{plays}. We compare the RMSE between HNN and LSTM networks, and it shows that HNN is significantly better than LSTM networks. 
Further, we generalize a financial market model with momentum trading strategies as an illustrative application. We evaluate the performance between HNN and LSTM networks on this market model. It reveals HNN outperforms LSTM networks several times with fewer parameters.
