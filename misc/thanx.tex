Special thanks to PD. Dr. Pavel Gurevich, Dr. Hannes Stuke, and Dr. Nikita Begun for their guidance and support. Without their help, I cannot finish my work. They gave me detailed instructions and useful advice. 

Furthermore, I would like to thank my parents. They encouraged me whenever I was frustrated.
