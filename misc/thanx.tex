I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Sebastian Pokutta at Zuse Institute Berlin for giving me the opportunity to finish the research in this field.

Special thanks to Dr. Pavel Gurevich, Dr. Hannes Stuke, and Dr. Nikita Begun for their guidance and supports. Without their immense support, I cannot finish my dissertation. They gave me detailed instructions and useful advice. I really appreciate their efforts and encouragement throughout my master thesis.  
Furthermore, I would like to thank my parents. They encouraged me whenever I was frustrated.
