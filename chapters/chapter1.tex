\chapter{Introduction\label{cha:chapter1}}

% i sent you my comments by email. in general, i would recommend to restructure your introduction (and thesis) as follows:
% 1. your goal is to approximate a wide class of hysteretic processes by neural networks.
% 2. hysteretic processes have memory, introduce different hysteresis operators, say that Preisach is quite general, and it can be approximated by a linear combination of generalized (nonlinear) plays.
% 3. RNNs can approximate processes with memory, but standard architectures such as LSTM are not good enough.
% 4. that's why you develop a new architecture, namely HNN - this is your first result! it is a realization of a linear combination of nonlinear plays and hence approximates any Preisach operator (cf. item 2)
% 5. you compare hnn with lstm for learning hysteretic input-output relations and show that hnn is better. this is your second result!
% 6. you generalize a hysteretic market model from Dima and Kreiji by including N-agents. this is your third result!
% 7. you learn this model using hnn and lstm and show that hnn is better. this is your fourth result!

% cover: what's hysteresis, what's stop, play, preisach, applications of hysteresis. from physical applications to financial applications
\textit{Hysteresis} (see \myfigref{fig:chapter1:hysteresis-loop,fig:chapter1:non-ideal-relay,fig:chapter1:stop,fig:chapter1:play}) is defined as a \textit{rate independent} process with \textit{local memory}  \citep{visintin2013differential}. The \textit{nonsmooth} operators like \textit{stop operator} \citep{krejci1996hysteresis} (see \myfigref{fig:chapter1:stop}), \textit{play operator} \citep{krejci1996hysteresis} (see \myfigref{fig:chapter1:play}), \textit{Preisach operator} \citep{visintin2013differential} and their generalizations are used as essential blocks to model dynamical systems with hysteresis. Hysteresis effects are encountered in many different fields of science, such as magnetic hysteresis, ferroelectric hysteresis, mechanical hysteresis, superconducting hysteresis, adsorption hysteresis\lackref{}, etc. More recently, applications of these nonlinearities range from medicine \citep{castellano2010thresholds,gleeson2011high,parshani2010epidemic} and biology \citep{friedman2014hysteresis} to economics and finance \lackref{}.
Especially in economics and finance fields, Preisach-type models, using \textit{non-ideal relay operator} (see \myfigref{fig:chapter1:non-ideal-relay}), have been used as tool to describe the macro dynamics of economic systems, which deliver hysteresis at both micro and macro levels as such a procedure of aggregation over individual heterogeneous agents.
Hysteresis in economics, typically based on suck adjustment costs\lackref{}, has been also well investigated in the relationship between economic facts and unemployment rate, exports and exchange rate  \citep{belke2013exchange,gocke2002various,belke2014hysteresis}. Naturally, an attempt to obtain quantitative models of these empirical observations motivated the use of the play operator and more complex models of hysteresis in the financial market trading context. 
% \lackref{Amable et al. (1994) who applied a model of hysteresis to the study of foreign trade, Lang and Peretti (2009) also found hysteresis in the dynamics of the unemployment rate, and Belke and Göcke (2001) documented hysteresis in the relationship between aggregate employment and the exchange rate.}.

% arguments that we can use hysteresis to model economy it's suitable

% play hysteresis is an presentation of macroeconomic data
% Hysteresis in economics, typically based on suck adjustment costs\lackref{}, has been also well investigated in the relationship between economic facts and unemployment rate, exports and exchange rate\citep{belke2013exchange,gocke2002various,belke2014hysteresis}. 
% Hysteresis in economics, typically based on suck adjustment costs\lackref{}, has been also well investigated in the relationship between economic facts and unemployment rate, exports and exchange rate. \citet{belke2013exchange} applied an approach which captures the path-dependent nonlinear dynamics on macro-level called \textit{play hysteresis} in German exports and implement an algorithm describing play-hysteresis into a regression framework. They found significant hysteresis effects for part of German exports. \citet{gocke2002various} illustrated an economic situation which is characterised by the most elementary form of hysteresis -- the so called \textit{non-ideal relay} to postulate different threshold values for each economic agent. In particular, it's possible to understand the provenance of hysteresis loops in relations among macroeconomic variables and introduces the concepts of rate independence, coercivity, and remanence into the analysis of diverse spheres of economic activities. Hysteresis phenomena has been also closely associated with other stylized facts such as path dependence\citep{belke2014hysteresis} and and multitude of equilibria that describe empirical economic data. Naturally, an attempt to obtain quantitative models of these empirical observations motivated the use of the play operator and more complex models of hysteresis in the financial market trading context. 

% \mypaper{hysteresis effects in economics -- different methods for describing economic path-dependence} 
% \cite{gocke2015play} presented simple linearized play dynamics as a marco approximation of aggregate hysteresis on both supply and demand side in market model. It made remanent effects of transient shocks between demand and supply hysteresis become obvious. 

% to extend the path-dependent feedback effects in market supply and demand model.
% For example, the play operator was shown to produce a good model of the dependence of supply and demand on the price[7,23].
% This model was fitted to micro-economic data based on a survey of German beer exports. It replaces the demand and supply curves by play operators and predicts well the observed price rigidity. 
% The Preisach operator has been applied to modeling hysteresis in unemployment[16].
% Furthermore, w phenomenology of these hysteresis models is compatible with the multi-agent modeling framework typical for economic models with play hysteresis\lackref{}. 


\citet{dima2014} used Prandtl-Ishlinskii (PI) \lackref{} networks to model momentum-based trading strategies within a financial market, generalizing the model by supposing that the market agents also have a network structure and each agent reacts not only to the price but to the states of their network neighbors. It provides a promising insight to make play-hysteresis economic models compatible with multi-agent modeling framework\lackref{}. However, they only considered single trading strategy that agents take reaction to the change of \textit{price trend}, called \textit{agents D}\lackref{} in this thesis, to simulate market movements. Another trading strategy, which is also common in financial trading pattern, is also threshold-based where agents in markets are sensitive to the change of some \textit{fixed price value}\lackref{} instead of \textit{price trend}, called \textit{agents N}\lackref{show that why it's common} in this thesis. 
% \mytodo{add some papers training hysteretical neural network} 

Given an observation of price $x_n \, (n=1,\ldots, N)$ to predict future movements
% \textit{up} or \textit{down}, 
of market, regression method is used to forecast future price and it usually minimizes mean square error between predicted price $\hat{x}_n \, (n=1,\ldots, N)$ and observed prices.
% $$\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} (\hat{p}_n - p_n)^2$$
Intuitively, recurrent neural network (RNN) is one optional approach to deal with this time-series data without hypothesis of trading strategies. Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTM) \citep{hochreiter1997long} is kind of RNN which is widely applied in stock market movements predictions \citep{stock_market_price_movement_prediction_with_LSTM_neural_networks,an_innovative_neural_network_approach_for_stock_market_prediction,daniel2019financial}.
\mytodo{\mypaper{A LSTM-based method for stock returns prediction - A case study of China stock market}}
% \citet{stock_market_price_movement_prediction_with_LSTM_neural_networks} studied the usage of LSTM networks on predictions future trends of stock prices based on the price history, alongside with technical analysis indicators. The results that were obtained are promising, getting up to an average of 55.9\% of accuracy when prediction if the price of a particular stock is going to increase or decrease in the near future. \citet{an_innovative_neural_network_approach_for_stock_market_prediction} considered the deep LSTM with embedded layer and the LSTM with automatic encoder to predict the stock market. The accuracy is about 57.2\%. \citet{daniel2019financial} scaled original technical indicators and feeding thoes features as input into LSTM network. In his experiments, the model results in a validation precision of 68.59\%.
Those methods works as well. However, the input of regression methods are often timestamp and technical indicators, which is hard to explain and analyze the results of methods. 
\mytodo{Often, the results are contradictory.}

% Main results
Instead, we develop a \textbf{new market model} \todo{Can we say it's a new model?} with the combination of two different agents together, \textit{agents D} and \textit{agents N} based on play operator and non-ideal relay operator respectively, and study a new architecture of neural network to capture hysteresis loops for our market model, so-called \textbf{hysteretic neural network (HNN)} (see \myfigref{fig:chapter1:nn-arch}). We emphasize that HNN can be widely applied in many scenarios with hysteretic effects mentioned above, market trading is only one of applications fully discussed in this thesis. In contrast to most regression methods which generate averaged predictions of the target, HNN \todo{the mathematical model provides a distribution of targets} provides \textbf{distribution of predictions} and how uncertain the predictions are. Moreover, HNN is able to interpret the \textbf{avalanche of market movements} \todo{Is it convincing enough till now in our experiments to show this result?} inherently since it contains agents that use trading strategies in micro level.

% We are interested in predicting price $p_{n+1}$ at timestamp $n+1$ corresponding to observed historical price $P = [p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}]$, using HNN. 
% We emphasize, unlike most regression methods, we train HNN by feeding historical price $P \in \mathbb{R}^N$ into networks and predict next price $p_{n+1}$ within the same network. 

% Instead, under some reasonable assumptions, we model two different agents mentioned above inside market. They  decide to hold or sell the share according  tothe change of price and their strategies. In other word, price fluctuation is caused by the unobserved changes inside market self.

% We provide detailed analysis of our market model, a new architecture of recurrent neural network, so-called \textbf{hysteretical neural network(HNN)} (see \myfigref{fig:chapter1:nn-arch}), and how to learn the market model from neural network.

% The first method, we assume that we know historical price $P \in \mathbb{R}^N$ and the corresponding unobserved changes of market states $B \in \mathbb{R}^N$. Then we make gradient-descent step in the direction of minimization mean square error(MSE) of the neural network until convergence. $$\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} (\hat{b}_n - b_n)^2$$
% Obviously, the first approach is a toy model since we cannot obtain the inner state of market in real scenarios. However, it proves HNN trainable. Then it comes to the second approach. Since we cannot observe the whole sequence of data $B$, we assume that $B=[b_0, b_1, \ldots, b_{n}]$ is generated from random walk, where $b_{n+1} = b_{n} + \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma)$. $G(p_n; W)$ represents the whole network with known weights $W$ and the output of it is $b_n$.

% Now let's come back to HNN itself. Based on \citet{dima2014}, assume that price $p_n$ hysterecially depends on the underlying noise $b_n$, with $b_n$ being a Brownian motion.

Back to HNN in this thesis, we assume that its input is observed price $\mathcal{X}_n = [x_1, \ldots, x_{n}]$ and output is unobserved random walk $\mathcal{B}_n=[b_0, b_1, \ldots, b_{n}]$. Sequence $\mathcal{B}$ holds $b_{n+1} = b_{n} + \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma)$ and $\mathcal{N}$ is Gaussian distribution. Based on our market model which generalizes from \citet{dima2014}, the underlying $b_n$ is expressed as a Preisach hysteresis operator depending on the (observed) prices $x_n$, i.e.,
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:chapter1:dima-model-assumption}
    b_n = G(\mathcal{X}_n; W_b)
\end{equation}
where $G$ is a hysteresis operator parameterized by a vector $W_b$. The vector $W_b$ contains the weights of the whole networks. We learn the parameters $W_b$ and $\mu$ of the network $G$ by maximizing the likelihood of $\mathcal{X}_n$. Since $\mathcal{X}_n$ is the determenistic function \myformularef{eqn:chapter1:dima-model-assumption} of a random variable $\mathcal{B}$, its probability density is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:chapater1:pdf-transformation}
    p(\mathcal{X}) = p_b\Big(G(\mathcal{X}_1, W_b), \ldots G(\mathcal{X}_n, W_b)\Big)\left|\det \mathcal{J(X)}\right|
\end{equation}
where $p_b$ is the distribution of $\mathcal{B}$ and $\mathcal{J(X)}$ is the Jacobian matrix. \textbf{Thus, to maximize the log-likelihood of $p(\mathcal{X})$ is equivalent to maximize the log-likehood of right-hand side in \myformularef{eqn:chapater1:pdf-transformation}}

% \begin{eqnarray}
%     p_b({\mathcal{B}}) &=& \prod_{n=1}^{N} p_b(b_1, b_2, ..., b_N) \\
%                   &=& \prod_{n=1}^{N} p_b(b_n|b_{n-1}) \\
%                   &=& \prod_{n=1}^{N} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \sigma} \exp\left(-\frac{(b_{n}-b_{n-1}-\mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2}\right)

% however, play hysteresis is in two aspects different to the micro non-ideal relay loop. First, the play loop shows \textit{no discontinuities}. Second, analogous to mechanical play (e.g. when steering a car), the \textit{play/inaction area} is shifted with the history of the forcing variables: every change in the direction of the movement of the forcing variable starts with traversing a play/inaction area. Only after this play is passed, a stronger reaction (called ‘spurt’) will result, if the forcing variable continues to move in the same direction.

% current methods using in stock markets
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Stock market predictions have been at focus in the past decades since it can guide investors to make better decisions in the chaotic markets. Analyzing stock price movement in real-world market is one of most challenging tasks in academical studying fields because it inherently involves lots of uncertain factors, such as human sentiments, phenomena of financial market and different trading strategies. The well studied methods of predicting price movement focus on \lackref{fundamental analysis} and \lackref{technial analysis}. 

% Under assumption that the stock price of a company mainly relies on its real value, fundamental analysis has ability to predict long-term price movement systematically before they show up in the real market. However, it's hard for us to formalize this kind of knowledge to build a trading automation(such as artificial neural network) for short-term predictive purpose\cite{state_of_the_art_in_stock_prediction_techniques}.
% As for technical analysis, it's an approach of evaluating stocks by analyzing statistics generated by market activities, historical prices and volumes. We assume that most investors in the market react to changes in predictable ways, so it's highly suitable for us to model an automation to predict market trends\cite{state_of_the_art_in_stock_prediction_techniques}.
% The method proposed in short-term prediction are mainly focus on technical indicator, logistic regression\cite{using_ai_to_make_predictions_on_stock_market}, support vector regression\cite{using_ai_to_make_predictions_on_stock_market}, and artificial neural network\cite{using_ai_to_make_predictions_on_stock_market, artificial_neural_networks_approach_to_the_forecast_of_stock_market_price_movements, an_innovative_neural_network_approach_for_stock_market_prediction,stock_market_price_movement_prediction_with_LSTM_neural_networks}. \todo{add more reference here}


% %% SVM
% Zheng\cite{using_ai_to_make_predictions_on_stock_market} simplified prediction on price trends as classification problems, predicting whether the future price will go up or not in the next $n$ days based on the stock prices and volumes in the past $m$ days. For simplified problem, they compared the performance of different approaches, logistic regress, bayesian network, simple neural network and svm with rbf kernel. And support vector regression outperforms other methods with an accuracy of 69.5\% for the highest.
% %% LSTM
% Intuitively, recurrent neural network(RNN) is xxxxxxxx. Long Short Term Memory networks(LSTM) is kind of RNN which is widely applied in real-world \lackref{applications} to deal with time series data sets. Nelson \cite{stock_market_price_movement_prediction_with_LSTM_neural_networks} studied the usage of LSTM networks on predictions future trends of stock prices based on the price history, alongside with technical analysis indicators. The results that were obtained are promising, getting upt to an average of 55.9\% of accuracy when prediction if the price of a particular stock is going to increase or decrease in the near future.  Pang\cite{an_innovative_neural_network_approach_for_stock_market_prediction} considered the deep LSTM with embedded layer and the LSTM with automatic encoder to predict the stock market. The accuracy is about 57.2\%.
% %% CNN with wavelets
% Persio\cite{artificial_neural_networks_approach_to_the_forecast_of_stock_market_price_movements} combined CNN and wavelets to do predictions on price movement, which achieves a correction rate of 62\% on S\&P500 data sets.
% %% hidden markov models
% Aditya Gupta\cite{stock_market_prediction_using_hidden_markov_models} proposed HMMs. This HMM is then used to make a maximum a Posterior decision over all the possible stock values for the next day. However, many of them have certain drawbacks related to the lack of stability and reproducibility. And their results are often paradoxical in the same model. 

% %% motivation
% Based on \cite{analytical_solution_for_a_class_of_network_dynamics_with_mechanical_and_financial_application}, \lackref{momentum-based} trading strategies can be modeled as \lackref{PI networks} with discontinuous \lackref{PR functions}. We study an alternative approach to predict market trend based on what we call \textit{hysteretic neural network(HNN)}. We are interested in predicting price $p_{n+1}$ at timestamp $n+1$ corresponding to observed historical price $P = [p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}]$, using HNN. We emphasize, unlike most regression methods, price on timestamp, we train HNN by feeding historical price $P \in \mathbb{R}^N$ into networks and predict next price $p_{n+1}$ within the same network. For further details, we refer to \mytodo{refer to how to predict next price}. 

% Given an observation of price $p_n(n=1,\ldots, N)$, \lackref{most regression methods} minimize mean square error between predicted price $\hat{p}_n (n=1,\ldots, N)$ and observed prices. $$\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} (\hat{p}_n - p_n)^2$$
% Those methods works as well. However, the inputs of regression methods are often timestamp and technical indicators, which is hard to explain and analyze the results of methods. Often, the results are contradictory. Instead, under some reasonable assumptions we propose(\mytodo{see market models of our thesis)}, the price fluctuation is caused by the unobserved changes inside real-world market self. In this thesis, we providing detailed analysis of our market model and learn this market model from HNN. We propose \mytodo{2(maybe three methods after updating)} different ways to train HNN for one specific time-series data set generated from our model. 

% The first method, we assume that we know historical price $P \in \mathbb{R}^N$ and the corresponding unobserved changes of market states $B \in \mathbb{R}^N$. Then we make gradient-descent step in the direction of minimization mean square error(MSE) of the neural network until convergence. $$\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} (\hat{b}_n - b_n)^2$$

% Obviously, the first approach is a toy model since we cannot obtain the inner state of market in real scenarios. However, it proves HNN is trainable. Then it comes to the second method. Because we cannot observe the whole sequence of data $B$, we assume that $B=[b_0, b_1, \ldots, b_{n}]$ is generated from random walk, where $b_{n+1} = b_{n} + \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma)$. One iterates the whole training data sets via \mytodo{direct learning, set reference in my thesis} to minimize negative log-likelihood of predictive distribution of random walk $B$ till convergence.

The thesis is organized as follows. In the next chapter, it presents two different types of agents in the financial market and shows how to generate synthetic data for training and test. In chapter 3, a detail methodology for the HNN is discussed, explaining how we approximate the momentum-based trading strategies by neural networks, establishing the relationship between HNN and market model, and formulating the method of learning the ground truth weights from the random walk. In chapter 4, we evaluate performance between LSTM and HNN in different aspects, including the complexity of data sets, network complexity and the accuracy of predicted results. The last chapter contains our conclusions and future works.
