\section{Attribute to compare}\label{}
\mytodo{complexity of synthesis data set (nb plays/nb units/random weights/noise)} \\
\mytodo{number of sequence length (points)} \\
\mytodo{number of parameters to use in the network, our network is smaller and can  achieve the same performance as (lstm/rnn/gru)} \\
\mytodo{training loss curve} \\
\mytodo{time consumption during train/prediction} \\
\mytodo{(mean square error/cross entropy) on prediction data set}

\section{HNN}\label{}
\mytodo{show animation plots that indicate hnn could capture minor loops whereas lstm fails} \\
\mytodo{show mse loss, network complexity} 

\section{HNN for market model}\label{}
\mytodo{compare network complexity, mle loss} \\
\mytodo{compare the markov chain obtain by lstm and hnn} \\
\mytodo{show animation that lstm performs worse due to cannot capture minor loops.} \\
\mytodo{show that hnn can reconstruct agents behavior} \\
\mytodo{show that hnn can give a distribution of price, not average of price} \\
\mytodo{show that hnn can explain the avalanche of market} \\
