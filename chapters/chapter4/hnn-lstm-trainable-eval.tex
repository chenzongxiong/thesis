\section{LSTM HNN Comparsion}\label{sec:chapter4:lstm-hnn-comparsion}

Attribute to compare

0. complexity of systhesis data set (nb_plays & nb_units & random weights & noise)
1. number of sequence length (points)
2. number of parameters to use in the network, our network is smaller and can achieve the same performance as (lstm/rnn/gru)
3. training loss curve
4. time consumption during train/prediction
5. (mean square error/cross entropy) on prediction data set
