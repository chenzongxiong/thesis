\section{HNN is inverse}
% \mytodo{proof of neural network inverse}

We call HNN as $G$ and the inverse function of $G$ is $F$.
In this section, we show that the inverse $G$ can be approximated by another network $F$ (trained as \ref{xxx}). 
% is an experiment to see whether HNN is inverse or not.

\textbf{Data sets.} First we sample inputs $x(n)$ from function $sin(n)$. 
we create different data sets with different number of $plays$ and $units$.
