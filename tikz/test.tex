% Due to LaTeX's reading-apparatus which has that nice `\endlinechar`-thingie,
% reading and tokenizing colorlist.csv yields that each end of a line of
% colorlist.csv will result in the insertion of an explicit space token into
% the token stream.
% Thus the comma-character-tokens that stem from the commas at the ends of lines
% will be trailed by explicit space tokens while the comma-character-tokens that
% stem from commas not at the ends of lines don't have these trailing space tokens.
% The ending of the last line of colorlist.csv does also yield the insertion
% of an explicit space token.
% Anything nested inside curly braces is protected from being replaced by
% \StrSubstitute.

% Let's replace the commas at line endings by //:
\expandafter\StrSubstitute\expandafter{\tempa}{, }{//}[\tempa]%
\show\tempa
% Let's replace the commas not at line endings by /:
\expandafter\StrSubstitute\expandafter{\tempa}{,}{/}[\tempa]%
%\show\tempa
% Let's replace the line endings (they are now denoted by //) by commas:
\expandafter\StrSubstitute\expandafter{\tempa}{//}{,}[\tempa]%
%\show\tempa
% Let's remove all remaining space-tokens - this does remove
% the space that came into being due to the end of the last
% line of colorlist.csv
\expandafter\StrSubstitute\expandafter{\tempa}{ }{}[\tempa]%
